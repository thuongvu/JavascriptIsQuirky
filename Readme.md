Javascript Is Quirky (Work in Progress)
==============================================

Inspired by mrdavidlaing's JavaScript Koans, I decided I would make my own "Koans" in order to learn more about vanilla JavaScript.

These are failing unit tests that you can compelete in order to learn more about many of javascript's quirks!  

I cannot claim sole credit, as I will heavily base this on examples from http://javascriptissexy.com and Nicholas Zakas' book, Professional JavaScript for Web Developers.
